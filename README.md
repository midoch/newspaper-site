# Newspaper site project

## Task

Recreate a figma layout, of a newspaper site. Get it as close as possible, and add your own taste of style for the responsive layout for mobile devices

## Thoughts

This was an assignment within a school project. I learned more about html, css and more JS.
i also improved on responsive layout for the mobile devices and ipad devices. I learned more about how to layout the semantics tags and attributes
also learned about validation within forms. which i found to be pretty nice.
